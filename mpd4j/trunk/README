Mpd4j 0.1
---------
Mpd4j is a Java class for interface with a Music Player 
Daemon (http://www.musicpd.org). To compile Mpd4j you will
need the Java SDK 1.5+, available from http://java.sun.com
if neccessary.

Compiling
---------
Run Ant against the jar target using the supplied build.xml file

$ ant jar

This will compile the library, and place a jar file in the dist/ 
directory containing mpd4j.jar.

Using Mpd4j
-----------
The API is fairly straight-forward. Create an org.outerrim.mpd4j.Mpd4j
object, either passing in the hostname and port number that MPD is running
on. Methods can then be called on the Mpd4j object to interact with MPD.
